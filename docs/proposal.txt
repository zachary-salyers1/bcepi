Blue Chip Manufacturing
Prepared by: Salyers AI
Date: November 7, 2025
Valid Through: December 8, 2025
Prepared for: Ken Sanker, CEO

Executive Summary
Blue Chip Manufacturing has an opportunity to transform incomplete CRM data into a comprehensive, validated business intelligence asset. Based on our consultation, we've identified critical data quality gaps in your HubSpot CRM that are limiting sales effectiveness, marketing precision, and operational efficiency.
Projected Impact:
Data Completeness: 85-95% improvement in critical contact and company fields
Time Savings: 40+ hours monthly recovered from manual data entry and research
Sales Efficiency: 30-40% reduction in time spent verifying prospect information
Marketing Precision: Improved segmentation and targeting through complete NAICS codes and firmographic data
ROI Timeline: Immediate value upon deployment, full ROI within 2-3 months

Understanding Your Challenge
Current State
Blue Chip Manufacturing currently faces:
Challenge 1: Incomplete Contact Records
Your HubSpot contact database contains significant gaps in essential fields including names, phone numbers, addresses, company names, job titles, and email addresses. These incomplete records force your sales team to spend valuable time manually researching prospects rather than selling.
Challenge 2: Missing Company Intelligence
Company records lack critical firmographic data including NAICS codes, ownership structure (public/private/non-profit), employee counts, revenue figures, credit ratings, and verified company domains. This prevents effective segmentation, targeting, and risk assessment.
Challenge 3: Data Accuracy Concerns
Without a validation process, outdated or incorrect information persists in your CRM, leading to failed outreach attempts, damaged credibility, and wasted marketing spend on invalid contacts.
Business Impact
These challenges result in:
Reduced sales conversion rates due to incomplete prospect intelligence and poorly targeted outreach
Missed opportunities for strategic account prioritization based on company size, revenue, and credit worthiness
Inefficient marketing spend targeting contacts with incomplete or incorrect information
Compliance risks from outdated contact information and poor data governance

Proposed Solution
Solution Overview
We propose implementing an intelligent, automated data enrichment and validation system using Make.com workflow automation integrated with ZoomInfo, AI-powered validation, and your HubSpot CRM. This solution will:
Automated Data Enrichment: Systematically identify incomplete contact and company records in HubSpot, query ZoomInfo for missing data, and populate critical fields without manual intervention.
Multi-Source Validation: Before updating records, AI agents crawl company websites and LinkedIn profiles to cross-reference and validate ZoomInfo data, ensuring accuracy and reducing the risk of importing incorrect information.
Intelligent Company Profiling: Automatically enrich company records with NAICS codes, ownership structure, employee counts, revenue data, credit ratings, and verified domains to enable sophisticated segmentation and targeting.



Technical Approach
Technology Stack:
Make.com (workflow automation platform)
ZoomInfo API (primary data source)
Perplexity AI (AI validation and data extraction)
Web scraping capabilities (company website and LinkedIn validation)
HubSpot API (CRM integration)
Integration Method:
The automation connects directly to your HubSpot CRM via API, identifies records with missing fields, queries ZoomInfo for enrichment data, validates findings through AI-powered web research, and updates HubSpot records with verified information. The entire process runs automatically on a scheduled basis.
Data Requirements:
Access to your HubSpot CRM (API key), ZoomInfo credentials, and definition of critical fields for both contact and company records. All data processing occurs through secure API connections with no manual data exports required.
Security & Compliance:
All data transmission occurs via encrypted API connections. No customer data is stored outside of your HubSpot instance. The solution complies with GDPR and CCPA requirements through proper data handling and audit trails. ZoomInfo data usage follows their terms of service for CRM enrichment.
Why This Approach
Unlike hiring additional staff or purchasing expensive data quality software that costs $10,000-50,000+ annually, our AI-powered automation approach:
Leverages existing AI models and proven automation platforms, reducing costs by 70-85% compared to traditional data quality solutions
Implements in 1-2 weeks vs. 2-3 months for enterprise software deployment
Allows rapid iteration based on your specific data quality needs and business rules
Scales automatically as your database grows without additional per-seat licensing
Maintains data freshness through continuous, automated enrichment rather than one-time data appends
